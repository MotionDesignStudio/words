# words
This web application is intended to help writers understand the distinction among homonyms, homophones, homographs, heteronyms and antagonyms. 

Gaining proficiency in English challenges native speakers and E.S.L. (English as a Second Language) students, alike. It has many subtle rules which have very few predictable patterns as well as words that have overlapping spelling and pronunciation, yet divergent meanings. Some words have opposing sets of meaning. This makes it difficult to master. This software attempts to assist those interested in improving their knowledge of these subtleties.

This has been a solo project. To improve upon this, the backing of a community of language enthusiasts is needed. The larger a database of words, definitions and examples will add greatly to this project and its usability.


Within the following directory “pythonHelperFilesAndDatabaseFile” contains a python script used to populate the database via a system call.  It also contains a script used to web scrape http://dictionary.reference.com, http://thefreedictionary.com/ and http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/ .

The file wordsdb20150519.sql is the current copy of the database as of Wed Dec 30 13:59:53 EST 2015.
